# ✅ Fixes & Integration Complete

## 🎨 Issue #1: Overlapping Popups - FIXED ✅

### What Was Wrong
- Cookie consent and chat widget both had low opacity
- Same z-index caused overlap
- Glass effects blended with background
- Text was hard to read

### What I Fixed

**Cookie Consent Banner:**
- ✅ Increased z-index to `z-[100]` (highest priority)
- ✅ Solid dark background: `rgba(5, 5, 5, 0.95)` (95% opacity)
- ✅ Purple border and glow for visibility
- ✅ Stronger backdrop blur
- ✅ Clear separation from background

**Live Chat Widget:**
- ✅ Z-index set to `z-50` (below cookie banner)
- ✅ Cyan theme (different from purple banner)
- ✅ Solid dark background: `rgba(5, 5, 5, 0.95)`
- ✅ Cyan border and glow
- ✅ Clear, readable message bubbles
- ✅ Distinct header and input sections

### Visual Hierarchy Now:
```
z-[100] = Cookie Consent (purple border) - Appears first
z-50    = Chat Widget (cyan border) - Below cookie banner
z-40    = Exit Popup
z-30    = Announcement Banner
z-0     = Page Content
```

**Result:** Both popups are now clearly visible, distinct from each other, and easy to read!
